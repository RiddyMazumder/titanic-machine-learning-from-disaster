# 🚢 Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster

Predicting passenger survival on the Titanic using machine learning.

This project is based on the classic **Kaggle Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster** challenge. The goal is to build a predictive model that determines whether a passenger survived the Titanic shipwreck based on available features such as age, gender, class, and fare.
